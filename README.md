This is a basic Ticket System made as a learning project using node/express and mongodb. It provides a start page where one can request a short url which redirects to the provided original url.

To make it work:

    clone the repository
    run 'npm install' inside the directory to install dependencies (you need to have npm installed)
    set up a mongodb database and write its connection url as an environment variable in a .ENV file (I used a free mongodb Atlas M0 cloud database)
    run 'npm run start' to start the server locally. Then, you can access the page in your browser via localhost:3000.
